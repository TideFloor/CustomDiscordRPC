Provide a name for your application.
After creating the application, you'll be redirected to the dashboard for your newly created application.
Setting up OAuth2:

On the dashboard of your application, locate and click on the "OAuth2" tab.
Copy the "Client ID" from the "General Information" tab, as it will be required for configuration.

Setting up Rich Presence:

Go to the "Rich Presence" tab in the Discord Developer Portal.
Here, you can add images or other assets by uploading them under the "Art Assets" section.
The names you assign to these images will serve as keys for referencing them later in your code.
